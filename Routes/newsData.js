        "Quite a good number of Indian films are making their way to the theaters in Japan. Thanks to Rajamouli's Baahubali and RRR that opened the gates a little more for Indian cinema.

        "Bollywood experts had set their sights on Gadar 2 and OMG 2 clashing at the box office on the Independence Day weekend. But it looks like Sunny Deol and Ameesha Patel's movie will have a clear run because OMG 2 makers are reportedly upset with the CBFC. After the whole hullabaloo around Adipurush, CBFC has become more careful about films with religious context. It has been reported by Bollywood Hungama that the Revising Committee has suggested 20 cuts to the makers of OMG 2. These also include audio and video deletions. Moreover, they have suggested that they go in for an adults only certification for the movie. Initially, there were rumours that OMG 2 had a LGBTQ angle but the makers denied the same. Pankaj Tripathi told people not to believe anything that was being said. But it looks like the film does have a theme of sex education somewhere. It seems the makers are unhappy with the cuts as they feel it will ruin the essence of the movie. The source told the portal, They are also not okay with an A certificate. After all, they feel that the topic of sex education should be seen by people of all ages. The first installment of OMG came out in 2012, and kids loved the film. The makers feel it is not right to have an adult rating for a kid-friendly franchise.

        "While people are very much in awe of their star parents,  they are featured on page three and every breath they take catches media attention.Some love them for their lineage. Some are mystified by them for living a life most people can not even dream of. Then there are others who cannot help but ignore the unnecessary coverage the star kids get, without any personal or professional achievements. One thing is for sure though, there is no ignoring these future stars. Which is why the news of Suhana gracing a popular magazine cover is currently trending on Twitter.So is being a student, theatre lover and future star enough to get you on the cover of Vogue?If a twenty-something girl walks up to the Vogue's office tomorrow, insisting to be featured on their cover, because she is a student, theatre lover and future star, she would be kicked out even before she can spell entitlement. But these are the very qualities which make Suhana Khan worthy of featuring on Vogue’s cover.The magazine organised a photo shoot to introduce Khan to the world. And used these three designations to describe why Suhana is on the cover. Which one of these can we count as Suhana’s achievement? In fact, the future star is a punch on our nepotism-criticising mouths.SOME TAKEAWAYSShah Rukh Khan’s daughter Suhana Khan has recently featured on the Vogue's cover.The magazine introduces her as a student, theatre lover and future star.This fascination of the common public with star kids is also a reason why nepotism is thriving in Bollywood.Khan is going to be a star, cry all we want. Just the fact that she has a launchpad awaiting her, whenever she is ready, is worth a cover.It shows us the power of being a star kid. It shows us how these star kids just glide into the business of making films, without having to lift a finger. However, if Suhana’s popularity on social media is anything to go by, then we cannot blame Bollywood for nepotism entirely.It is the public obsession with star kids, that makes them entitled to a career in the movie industry. If Vogue today has featured Suhana on their cover, then her popularity on social media plays a big role in it. Even her fan made accounts on Instagram and Twitter enjoy a massive following. People are smitten by her and whatever she does becomes news.So when a magazine is making a star kid more popular, what right do people have to dump the entire blame on nepotism in Bollywood?Be it Janhvi Kapoor or Suhana Khan, those who share their pictures, follow them on social media or buy any magazine which features them, are also responsible.Judging by the looks of it, Khan will enjoy a pompous debut. And we will be plagued with the news about her, just like we were last month, when another star kid made her debut. Things won’t change, because people’s obsession with them won’t die down. They adore Suhana for her parentage. Her beauty is exemplified by her high-profile lifestyle. Just the fact that she was born into a world which most Indians only dream of makes her entitled. So my dear fellows, it is the publics obsession with Khan and the likes of her, why we have to endure a Dhadak or a Student Of The Year.Swallow this cover and Khans popularity, along with your argument on nepotism like a bitter pill. Because unless we stop fawning over them, star kids are not going anywhere.Also Read : Janhvi Kapoors Debut: Can Media Stop Obsessing Over Her Now?Yamini Pustake Bhalerao is a writer with the SheThePeople team, in the Opinions section.

        "SS Rajamouli’s magnum opus RRR, starring Jr NTR and Ram Charan, wreaked havoc in the theaters upon its release in 2022. Making India proud, the film’s Natu Natu song bagged the prestigious Best Original Song award at the Oscars 2023, becoming the first Indian song to achieve the feat on foreign soil. Fans, wishing to see more of the camaraderie between RRR’s two protagonists, can be assured that their wishes are almost granted. RRR’s co-scriptwriter V Vijayendra Prasad, who also happens to be SS Rajamouli’s father has confirmed that an RRR sequel is underway. This time, the film’s sequel is expected to be set against the backdrop of Africa. Jr NTR and Ram Charan will once again be reprising their roles in the second installment of RRR. In a conversation with Bollywood Hungama, V Vijayendra Prasad put forward a cryptic answer when asked about the RRR sequel. “It’s both a yes and a no,” he said, before adding that after RRR’s release, he shared a sketchy idea of the story’s continuation in Africa with his son SS Rajamouli. “After the release of RRR I shared an idea of the sequel where the story continues with Sitarama Raju (Ram Charan) and Komaram Bheem (NTR Jr) set in Africa,” revealed Prasad After hearing the concept of the RRR sequel, V Vijayendra Prasad said that SS Rajamouli gave his approval to the second segment. The director even urged his father to develop the idea into a full-fledged script. However, Rajamouli is presently working on another project with Mahesh Babu, tentatively titled SSMB29. According to Prasad, Rajamouli will only give his full attention to the RRR sequel once he wraps up the Mahesh Babu-starrer.“Knowing my son’s temperament he will not pay any attention to the sequel idea till the movie with Mahesh is finished,” said V Vijayendra Prasad. The acclaimed scriptwriter hinted that an RRR sequel can only start rolling when Rajamouli, Ram Charan, and Jr NTR agree with the script after they finish with their respective work commitments.Earlier, while speaking with a Telugu news channel, V Vijayendra Prasad revealed that SS Rajamouli might not direct the RRR sequel. Most likely, it will be helmed by a Hollywood filmmaker, whose identity he refused to disclose. However, Rajamouli would supervise the project, if and when it happens.",

Known for his charming personality, stellar performances, and on-fleek dance moves, Allu Arjun’s fandom can be heard on a global scale. And now, the Pushpa actor has become the first Indian celebrity to rake up 1 million followers on Threads.

Threads was launched by Meta on July 6. Just a few days later, Allu Arjun marked his presence in the newly launched application. He posted a black and white picture of himself, looking dapper like always, and sporting round-rimmed, transparent glasses. Soon after the actor dropped the picture on Threads, announcing his debut in Instagram's parent company, Meta, fans swamped the photo with likes and comments. Within days, he achieved the impossible feat of garnering the coveted one million mark on Threads, thanks to his widespread popularity In the comments of Allu Arjun’s first picture, fans of the actor congratulated him for the accomplishment, without even trying for it. One user claimed that they joined Threads just because of Allu Arjun and wrote, “First Indian actor cross in 1 million Followers in threads. Maine aap ke liye Threads app join Kiya sir (I’ve joined the Threads app just because of you sir).” “Congrats anna. It's time to party for 1m followers. And the 1st Indian actor to reach 1m followers.

      description:"Has the film The Kashmir Files set a cat among pigeons? It would appear so with the number of feathers it seems to have ruffled in less than a week of its release among those who were party to the forced exodus and/or responsible for the violence. As far as the common citizen is concerned, after watching the film he wonders how such a ghastly event could take place in a free and democratic India of the nineties. Some, the more responsible ones, perhaps even feel ashamed of not being aware that such atrocities and violence had been perpetuated against some of their own by a section of their own. The Kashmiri Pundits, an intellectually inclined and prosperous community, became refugees in their own country. Can anything be more brutal or shameful?Why was the establishment, both in the state and at the Centre, missing from action as neither did anything to stoop the holocaust that unfolded? More than 400,000 Pundits were forced out of the state and rendered homeless, more than 4,000 were killed and uncountable atrocities were perpetuated against their women and children. Why were the authorities so insensitive and unconcerned when Muslim mobs in Kashmir, led by militants, were creating mayhem among the minority Hindus? During all this, political parties and their leaders sat in their comfortable homes savoring the plight of the minority Hindus in the valley. It was no secret that they were hands in glove with the milita and separatists – some openly and others covertly. The amicability developed between Hindus and Muslims over generations went up in smoke as did friendships between individuals and familiHad the mobile and internet revolution occurred a few years earlier perhaps the nation would have been more aware of the happenings in Kashmir valley in 1990. Would that have made a difference to the plight of the unfortunate Hindu Pundits in the valley and their forced exodus? Without a doubt the nation would have been more aware on a real time basis. Given the power of internet and social media, there is certainly a case that the rest of the nation may have reacted. That may have forced the authorities to act instead of just sitting on the sidelines and watching rapes, murders and suffering of the original inhabitants of the Kashmir region at the hands of screaming Muslim moSurprisingly, most of the nation seems to have accepted the Kashmir holocaust as a fait accompli and moved on over the last three decades. The militants, separatists, state and national political leaders, government officials and above all the common Muslim residents of Kashmir too have moved on without any regret or remorse. Why has the nation never sought any accountability from these people? Why has the nation never introspected to understand why and how all this happened? Why did the state and the nation fail to develop a conducive environment for the return of the Hindus to the valley? These are difficult questions to answer but a few facts do stand oA deliberate attempt was made by the state and central governments to brush the happenings under the carpet and underplay the whole episode. This is evident from the Congress government’s position in 1996 when they termed the forced exodus and genocide of Hindus as ‘a self-imposed displacement’. The NHRC castigated the J&K government under Mr Farooq Abdulla for not doing anything to mitigate the plight of the Hindu Pundits in the years that followed. Separatist leaders were facilitated by the state and central governments despite their complicity. The media, that was not as pervasive then as it is today, just glossed over the happenings, perhaps under instructions from the government. The Hindu Pundits in Kashmir have always been more inclined towards intellectual, religious, philosophical, cultural and business pursuits. Militancy, violence, hatred and street fighting were never part of their character. Thus, physical resistance was minimal and in absence of support from the establishment, very few voices were raised against the genocide. Many among them had lost everything that they had built over generations. They had to put their heads down and think of the future of their families and loved ones instead of fighting for justice which in any case was not on offNeither the state nor the central government made any efforts to ensure the return of the Hindus to their homeland. If a dedicated effort had been made in the early nineties itself, perhaps a solution may have been found. Today, after three decades and a generation later, a point of no return seems to have been reached as many among the current generation of Kashmiri Pundits themselves may not be keen to return after having charted a fresh path in their lives by overcoming all the obstacles that came in their way. The film also exposes the claim of Farooq Abdullah, who it is mentioned, was the Chief Minister of J & k then, and had resigned on 18th of January, 1990, a day before the genocide started. The genocide of Kashmiri Hindus took place on 19th & 20th January,1990. The question that needs to be asked, why did Farooq Abdullah resign on that date. There is reason to doubt that, as a head of the State, he was aware of, what was likely to happen the next two days. He must have got the intelligence as the head of the State. And may be because of that only, he might have resigned on 18th of January, 1990. Farooq Abdulla & his son Omar Abdullah have reportedly said that a Judicial Probe be conducted to find out who was responsible to fix the responsibility & accountability. The Central Government, it is felt, should really appoint a Judicial Commission and bring out what actually transpired & who were guilty. This is the minimum the present government should do, to assuage the hurt feelings of Hindus in general & Kashmiri Hindus in particul The silence of the mainstream media, while the Kashmiri Hindus were being brutally killed, women raped and murdered in broad daylight, with even kids not spared, also needs to be questioned. This is particularly, because the same mainstream media cries hoarse over any singular incident of a supposed lynching of a minority member, mainly a Muslim, without even confirming, whether it really was a case of lynching.  In the face of criminal silence of the politicians like, Farooq Abdullah of National Conference, who was the Chief Minister of J & K, when this genocide took place, Mehbooba Mufti of PDP & Congress leaders, and in the light of the revelations made through the research conducted by Vivek Agnihotri & Pallavi Joshi, it is imperative that, Kashmir File is reopened, & serious investigation carried out in the alleged genocide of Kashmiri Hindus.  A consoling statement by Jammu & Kashmir DGP, Dilbag Singh, that appeared in Times Now on March 22, 2022, saying that, the cases related to the exodus of Kashmiri Pandits from the valley in 1990 can be reopened, if there’s a specific need therefore needs to be welcomed. If all these cases reach a logical conclusion, nothing better could be provided to victims of terror, says Ex-DGP, S P Vaid in response, Times Now Bureau has reported.  The present government under the leadership of Narendra Modi should take the lead in this matter, considering that, the Jan-Sangh & its present avatar, Bharatiya Janata Party had been the only Political Party, which had been consistently agitating for the abrogation of Article 370 to bring J & K. into the Mainstream. The Party, in the process lost its first President, Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee under suspicious circumstances & also many of the leaders of RSS, its parent organization during the genocide.  The film Kashmir Files has brought forth one sad chapter in the history of modern Indian State, woefully neglected by those ruling at the Centre & the State of J & K for too long. The policy of appeasement of Muslims followed by Indian National Congress from the times of Struggle for Independence has been responsible for emboldening the fundamentalist elements among the Muslims. In the pre-Independence era, late Mahatma Gandhi’s support to the Khilafat Movement had led to the first major genocide of Hindus in Malabar, which unfortunately, Congress, along with Communists, tried to whitewash, describing it as a rebellion of agricultural labourers against the exploiting landlords.  In will be in the fitness of things that, the behaviour of the Indian National Congress and followed by it, other regional political parties, the left liberal intellectuals & media is scrutinized, in the light of the facts that have been brought to light by the Director of Kashmir Files & Pallavi Joshi through painstaking research & 700 hard-hitting interviews, that are testimonials from the first-generation victims of the genocide of the Kashmiri Hindus in the 1990s.",

      description:  "Mattel devoted the best part of a decade to distancing itself from the playful parodic pop of “Barbie Girl,” the 1997 über-hit by Scandi dance group Aqua. A lawsuit, in fact. Why so? Simply because the song’s plastic fantastic lyrics named Barbie a bimbo. How times have changed. Unto a world in which self-awareness is now corporate currency arrives the Greta Gerwig directed Barbie. A film in which Mattel’s blonde bombshell is not merely labelled a bimbo but accused of setting back feminism a half century. Don’t be fooled. As business is business, the film serves to reframe the narrative. That was yesterday, today’s Barbie is a paragon of inclusivity. And yet, there’s still the odd dig here that rings contemporaneous truth. It’s a peculiar beast, this; hybrid in intent and far from the film you might be expecting.As per Warner Bros’ exorbitant marketing campaign, which appears to have painted virtually the whole planet pink in recent months, Barbie is at its best when bathing in its own sauna of hot steamin’ camp. There are all-out dance routines, never-ending wardrobes, musical interludes, mermaids, fireworks, acrobatics and so much more. It’s all served on the most fabulous platter of production design – seriously, it’s glorious – and with a frankly delicious side helping of the sardonic. Muppet-esque asides wink openly at the absurdity of Barbie’s world, all the while never undermining the imaginative power of childhood play. On waking of a morning, Barbie washes in a waterless shower, brushes her hair before an empty mirror frame and prepares waffles that she will never eat. There are no stairs in Barbieland. Barbie simply floats – or slides – from floor to floor. That’s the stuff you expected, right?How about extensive reference to Barbie and Ken’s lack of genitalia, not to mention a fervent attack on patriarchal constructs and whole narrative that hinges predominantly on existential crises? Perhaps not.Margot Robbie is Stereotypical Barbie. She’s the doll you think of when someone says “Barbie,” a replica of Ruth Handler’s original 1959 design. While her Barbieland kin enjoy employment as varied as lawyer, diplomat and president, Stereotypical Barbie wants no more from life than pink perfection on cyclical repeat. Life delivers. Or, rather, things are peachy right up until the point that Barbie starts to contemplate death and develop cellulite. On the behest of Weird Barbie (Kate McKinnon), Barbie heads to the real world for answers. Naturally, Ken (“just” Ryan Gosling) comes too. There’s no Ken without Barbie. She’ll learn some home truths, he’ll discover what it is to sit atop the patriarchy.The film is narrated by Helen Mirren, whose occasional interjections only add to the fun. Early on she proclaims Barbieland as the place ‘where all problems of feminism and equality can be solved.’ Imagine Barbie’s shock, then, when she is greeted in the real world not by hugs and thank yous but an ogling male gaze and disparaging female shrug. It’s a somewhat crude device that parallels the skewed gender dynamics of the real world with the matriarchy of Barbie’s: ‘Basically, everything that men do in your world, women do in ours.’The film imagines how a man – here embodied by several dozen Ken bros. – might respond to decades of the subjection enforced upon women throughout history. It’s a rather more binary construction than exists in the here and now and veers a little uncomfortably into gendered stereotype. Misogyny cannot be resolved by misandry and, while such is far from the film’s meaning or morality – gender is both a trap and emancipator here and both Robbie’s Barbie and Gosling’s Ken benefit from genuinely beautiful journeys of empowerment in the film – exaggerated mirroring can’t help but open this avenue for interpretation.Structurally, too, Barbie is, at times, unsettled by a crisis of critical identity. Here is a film that chastises Mattel for branding body dysmorphia while being completely complicit in the merchandising sales spike that will certainly follow its release. A brief glimpse of Wheelchair Barbie is quickly forgotten, while race is considered paintwork rather than a divergence of lived experience. When one character proposes Ordinary Barbie should be Mattel’s next invention, a suit is quick to note that such a doll would ‘make loads of money’. It’s a depressing indictment of a truth we know and accept. So potent is the inherent tonal confusion here that previews prior to the film in my screening promoted the new Luca Guadagnino offering in between the latest Illumination toon and Trolls 3. Talk about a threesome.In spite of Barbie’s more rooted faults, its outward strengths warrant acclaim. Robbie and Gosling are impeccable. There’s no denying this. Each excels in the delivery of a highly quotable script – ‘when I found out the patriarchy wasn’t about horses, I lost interest’ – and mines every ounce of the comic potential it has to offer. It’s all sublimely directed by Gerwig, whose eye for detail is extraordinary and engagement in the complexity of the mother-daughter relationship continues to pay dividends. Barbie may not be the total froth fest certain promos teased but exists nonetheless in a hot pink zeitgeist of its very own and is going nowhere. Well played Greta…or maybe Mattel?",

        "For a film four years in the making, Dead Reckoning doesn’t half land with peculiar resonance. This is the seventh in the Mission: Impossible film saga and first of a two-part extravaganza. It’s a blockbuster concerned with the perils of artificial intelligence, released in sync with the launch of Hollywood’s biggest strike in sixty years. A strike pitted against exactly that threat. Moreover, here is a feature driven, in part, by the hunt for a mysteriously missing submarine. This mere weeks after the Titan’s disappearance gripped the globe. It’s enough to make even Tom Cruise wrinkle an eyebrow, were he not behind a picket line somewhere, of course. And yet, for all this talk of contemporaneous thematic severity, where Dead Reckoning really proves itself in step with audiences of the here and now is in its recognising today’s want for escapist spectacle. That it delivers in spades.    While the M:I films, as spun from the Bruce Gellar television favourite, have never exactly taken themselves seriously, Dead Reckoning enjoys new peaks of high octane delirium. It is, at times, as though the old Looney Tunes are as much an influence as Bond here. Think Ethan Hunt (Cruise) meets the Road Runner. Such is not to suggest for a moment that the film lacks stakes and nail-biting action. Quite the contrary, Dead Reckoning often proves unbearably tense in its will to thrill. Rather, it is to note that the film is well complemented by a tongue firmly in cheek. For his third go at the M:I helm, Christopher McQuarrie rolls with the confidence of experience and dances well on the line of self-awareness that boarders parodic joy, without ever limiting the emotional sincerity of the whole.        Much as the Fast and Furious films parrot endlessly on the paramount importance of ‘family,’ comradeship reigns supreme here. Cruise has been defying the impossibility of missions for over a quarter of a century now and wears the part like a glove. As do Ving Rhames, a fellow OG teammate, and Simon Pegg, around since 2006. But when even newcomers feel indispensable to the cast, you know you have a sturdy ship. Here, Hayley Atwell makes for a sensational addition as the capable but out-of-her-depth pickpocket Grace, while Rebecca Ferguson and Vanessa Kirby glitter as and whenever they glide into scene. It’s a tight knit and expanding company. Not one member is left behind in the dust.        Speaking of which, an artic launchpad soon gives way to desert planes in the protracted pre-titles sequence to open the film. Hunt has been tasked with retrieving one half of a cruciform key from “it’s complicated” ally Ilsa Faust (Ferguson). What follows is a very typical globetrotting yarn, all hinged on the McGuffin du jour, but the execution itself is exquisite. At breakneck pace, a horseback pursuit gives way to sandstorm shootouts, followed swiftly by a fabulously layered airport escapade, deliriously exciting car chase and nail biting runaway train finale.        In stretching his narrative across two parts, McQuarrie benefits from a dearth of pressure to conclude the story within three hours. As such, each high octane set piece is afforded the breathing space required for true multilayered spectacle to flourish. Never mind talk of upping the game from Fallout, Dead Reckoning is a film that outdoes itself from scene to merry scene.        Equally top tier is the directorial flair with which McQuarrie leads a camera well polished by cinematographer Fraser Taggart. The range is extraordinary. A haunting early shot of underwater peril propels the launch of political intrigue. This is all Dutch angles and close cuts. What’s remarkable is how well such a tone is melded with the film’s more comedic inclinations. The deliciously old school union of Hunt with Atwell’s Grace injects screwball energy into an already bantakerous script, later paying dividends when action in Rome veers heavily into caper territory. Car chases can so easily bore but this is never going to be the case in a sequence that handcuffs our heroes and demands they escape in a tiny yellow Fiat 500. The sight of Grace doughnuting the old banger at the foot at the Spanish steps, watched by Pom Klementieff’s utterly baffled French assassin, may well prove to be the funniest scene of 2023. It’s very Italian Job.        All this builds to a climax much heralded in pre-release publicity. Cruise does indeed freewheel a motorbike off an obscenely rocky cliff, parachuting into the valley below. What the promotion didn’t reveal, however, was just how breathtaking the aftermath would be. Never mind ‘of the year’, Dead Reckoning’s final set piece must surely rank among the most extraordinarily tense ever committed to film. It’ll be hard to find a more potent reminder of the power of big screen entertainment to thrill this Summer. Part Two really cannot come soon enough.",

        "Remember that aura of dissatisfaction that haunted the multiplex as the credits rolled on 2008’s Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull? It was in the mutterings of malignancy that decried Shia LaBeouf’s irritating Mutt and ridiculed the risible extraterrestrial final act. You weren’t alone. Dial of Destiny, the fifth and final in the franchise, arrives lobbied by Harrison Ford himself and the screen icon’s personal penchant for an emotional encore. See also: The Force Awakens and Blade Runner 2049. Though seemingly unshared by Steven Spielberg, who steps back from directorial duties for the first time in the series, Ford’s passion is infectious. This one boasts some thunderously entertaining funIn the face of Cannes criticism, it is worth raising a brief remark in qualification. Dial brings virtually nothing new to the legend of Indiana Jones and has little of worth to add to contemporary discourse. Ford, 80, dominates, giving ‘em hell from open to close but Karen Allen, 71, merely cameos and is largely replaced by a younger model. Welshman John Rhys-Davies features as the decidedly Egyptian Sallah and there’s a whiff of unchallenged xenophobia in the film’s relationship to internationalism.Moreover, as penned by a round table of contributors, Dial’s script plunders a greatest hits of past highs, riffing on gags and set pieces, each thirty to forty years stewed in the cultural zeitgeist. As Indy and his latest co. globetrot in hot pursuit of MacGuffin du jour, served up is perhaps the most convincing argument for AI in screenwriting to date. And yet, it works. Where Dial flies – where AI would fall – is in the loving devotion with which the rote whole is brought to exhilarating life.Straight out of the blocks, a 1944 opening gets the boulder rolling with steam train top scrapping. Largely successful digital de-aging returns Ford to his eighties heyday in the face of a Nazi onslaught. Along with fellow archeologist Basil Shaw (Toby Jones – terrific), Jones seeks to liberate priceless artefacts from Hitler’s plunder. Among these is one half of the legendary Archimedes Dial, a clock face device with the power to transport its user in time. It’s not magic, we’re told, but maths so adds up. Besides, when your baseline is now shiny quartz skeletons with elongated heads, anything goes. In their way stands a typically dastardly Mads Mikkelsen, who plays Nazi scientist Jürgen Voller.Flash forward a quarter century and Indy’s an old wreck, creakier than the cobwebbed tombs he once explored. His wife and son are out of the picture and retirement looms. Enter stage right, Phoebe Waller-Bridge. The Fleabag star plays sharp-witted, nimble fingered grifter Helena, Basil’s kid and Indy’s goddaughter. She too seeks the dial, albeit with financial gain atop her agenda. All they need is a pint sized pickpocket – newcomer Ethann Isidore – and fun times ahoy. And, oh boy, are they fun. A charge on horseback through the New York Subway leads to bombastic Tuk Tuk chase in Tangier and deep sea eel attack in the Aegean, with a bonkers climax too perfectly preposterous to spoil. It’s all brought to peppy life by John Williams’ – allegedly final – score. A vintage rollick down musical memory lane.The foley too here is splendid. Each punch thrown – there are many – lands with a real thwack and there are some delightfully icky crunches. It is when revelling in the old school, rather than dabbling in dodgy green screen effects, that the film is at its best. You’d be hard pressed to call Dial of Destiny mature but there is a certain maturity to its relationship with time. Perhaps that’s to be expected from incoming director James Mangold, who has form here. It was he who, in Logan, collected the fragments of Hugh Jackman’s Wolverine for one last play in a more weather beaten toy box.This last Indiana Jones hasn’t quite the somber undertones of Logan but in its awareness that nothing lasts forever can’t help but carry a greater weight than its more jolly predecessors. A throwaway gag about dodgy knees and a hip replacement can’t help but feel close to the metal plate. And yet, as a final lunge for the old fedora attests, pop culture never truly forgets. ",

      description:
        "Looking back – almost three decades back – virtually nothing in the latest feature from Pixar could have been achieved at the dawn of computer animation. Certainly not with any credibility. In Elemental, the studio’s first all out cinema original since 2020’s Onward, flames lick the air with every smoking flicker. People made entirely of water osmose seamlessly in and out of photo real canals, while folk of bark and foliage sprout bright and casually stunning floristry from their branch pits. It’s as though one could reach forth and pluck petals from the screen itself. These days, Toy Story’s groundbreaking animation looks little more than child’s play in comparison. Elemental hasn’t the emotional gut-wrenchary of that original masterpiece but proves, twenty-seven films on, that Pixar still rides a wave of its innovative own even now The film’s premise is classic Pixar, almost to a fault. As Inside Out gave sentience to the emotions in our head, Elemental personifies the core elements of the world around us. These being earth, air, water and fire. While the latter two materialise in, more or less, humanoid form, the earth types stump around as might miniature orchards, with air beings existent like floating clouds of candy floss. Air and earth are, here, rather more superfluous to the film than fire and water, whose polarised dynamics serve up a ‘Romeo and Juliet’ tale of star-crossed lovers. It is a well-meant, sometimes cutting but equally clumsy, metaphor that adds to the melting pot themes of racial bias and a very pertinent parallel to contemporary structural racism in the western world.  As the film opens, a haze of sea mist gives way to the arrival of Bernie (Ronnie del Carmen) and Cinder (Shila Ommi) Lumin in Element City. Those aren’t their real names but phonetically simpler alternatives assigned to them by an immigration officer unable to grasp the language of Fire Landians. Such is the first of many hostilities the sky-scraping city presents to outsiders. A water-based transport network could extinguish the couple at any moment, while finding accommodation is no picnic when all the local landlords fear getting burnt. It’s here the allegory stumbles slightly. A man made of wood might very legitimately be wary of living up close and personal alongside a fellow who could reduce you to ashes in seconds flat. Moreover, the film fudges its potency by homogenising a half dozen cultures into a groundless notion of ‘the immigrant’. Even so, the idea is a neat one and the works well enough in context. Nobody in Element City will give the Lumens a chance, not even the in built metropolitan infrastructure.  As have the likes of Minari, In the Heights and, of course, Turning Red in recent years, Elemental’s chief concern is not the immigrant experience but that of the second generation. Leah Lewis voices the lively but hot headed Ember, daughter of Bernie and Cinder and heir to her father’s homegrown convenience store. Naturally, Ember’s compulsion is to please her father and live up to her parents’ dreams and ambitions for their new life. It takes the entrance of an outsider to help her realise that perhaps selling sparklers is perhaps not her dream: ‘Why does anyone get to tell you what you can do with your life?’ This is lachrymose dreamer boy Wade, voiced with gentle heart by Mamoudou Athie.  Elemental marks Pixar’s first out-and-out go at romantic comedy. While the result is never quite achingly romantic, there’s real warmth and wholesome loveliness here, not to mention some rib tickling comedy. Lewis and Athie prove exceptionally cast, with the former’s huskier tones perfectly pitched akin the latter’s more dulcet flow. Even if Ember and Wade’s path to love is a well pre-trodden one, earnest charm does well to enliven the journey. This is slight storytelling, true but well done indeed and beautifully designed. A sense that Elemental only scratches the surface of the world it creates is offset by standout scenes that show its boldly hued potential. Not an inch of the film’s extraordinarily wide screen fails to pop and there are gags in the detail here that will likely take three or four showings for the eagle eye to finally spot.  Yet, even whereby the microcosmic details elude, Elemental’s broader strokes will suffice. Quibbles aside, the film enchants when it counts and delivers big on top-tier art and design. Pixar may no longer be so consistent as once was in knocking innovation out of the park but when it comes to the core components of storytelling, they rarely fail. That much, you see, is elemental.",

        "Having been one of the last decade’s most prolific Hollywood stars, Jennifer Lawrence hasn’t half lain low in recent years. Between 2011 and 2017, Lawrence averaged three major releases per annum. Since 2020, the Time 100 listed Oscar winner hasn’t even knocked out one a year. What could coax such a talent back to Tinseltown? In 2019, it was the promise of working with Adam McKay. In 2022, the opportunity to try a hand at film production itself appealed. As for 2023’s No Hard Feelings, which hit cinemas on Wednesday, it was simply the funniest script the star had ever read. Hm.It is, true be told, hard to imagine even those whose buttons the film pushes considering No Hard Feelings remotely close to the upper echelons of cinematic funny. Take the title: a wry pun that’s too immature to be smart and too smart to embrace the immaturity. For the most part, the fault here is tonal. No Hard Feelings has better qualities than crass promotion might have promised but suffers for its attempts at being a great deal of different things to different ends, while somehow not quite succeeding in nailing any of themThe film offers, for instance, a revisitation for the noughties sex comedy, only without a whole lot of sex or, it must be said, comedy. The film is too a potent family drama, yet it’s a drama that sidelines the actual family for 90% of its runtime. As a cherry on the top, No Hard Feelings is even a surprisingly politically literate class commentary – but one without anything but the most superficial of comment to makeLawrence is, at least, excellent. As stranded, semi-broke millennial Maddie, the star’s effortless comic flair bursts from a decade of screen solemnity. It’s always been there. An ocean of red carpet memes and chat show sound bites serve testament to that. Even in the face of galling narrative ickiness, Lawrence largely prevails. It’s no mean feat in a film that asks her to sell grooming and unabashed sexual coercion as being anything other than entirely lacking in moral merit. Certainly, the film fails the gender-switch test. One can only imagine the ways a contemporary film might be decried were a thirty-two year-old man depicted coaxing a nineteen year-old female into sex on the promise of a post-coital Buick RegalSuch is the film’s legitimate premise. An OG resident of East Hampton hamlet Montauk, Maddie bridles annually at the Summer descent of wealthy New Yorkers into the neighbourhood. As rising taxes threaten to evict her from the home she inherited from her mother, Maddie finds herself in desperate need of funds. That’s even before her car is repossessed by a blighted ex. It’s worth noting here that Maddie part-times as an Uber driver. A rogue Craigslist ad – based on a real life listing – may, however, be her savour. Wanted: young woman to “date” younger, introverted virgin with overprotective parents. ‘Date him hard’. Should Maddie be able to coax said teen into the bedroom, and thereby loosen him up for his first year at Princeton, the family’s spare car is hersTo his credit, Broadway youngster Andrew Barth Feldman proves a worthy foil. In the hands of this one-time Evan Hanson, gawky Percy is far more than target practice for a sex predator. Sure, he’s a geeky introvert but, in contrast to his parents’ fears, Percy is kind of ok with that. It’s little surprise to find that Maddie has as much to learn from Percy as he her. His pubescent immaturity is nothing on her limited emotional development. There’s a warmth to the pair’s burgeoning friendship that belies the more brazen inclinations of the film around them. While a nude car chase amuses, it’s the scene after, in which Maddie dabs ointment on Percy’s anxiety rashes, that shines.",

        "Director Christopher McQuarrie previously revealed that a flashback segment that would have de-aged Tom Cruise in Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One was briefly considered. Now, McQuarrie is saying that the same segment — set in 1989 — also considered offering Julia Roberts a small role as a de-aged version of herself. Speaking on the Empire Spoiler Special podcast episode, McQuarrie said Roberts was envisioned as agent Ethan Hunt’s (Tom Cruise) lover. But the sequence was scrapped altogether, McQuarrie said, because he felt that the audience would too distracted by how an actor that I had known for however long was now suddenly this young person. Mariela Garriga eventually played the role in flashback. The film uses brief glimpses into Ethan Hunt’s life before he joined the IMF. “I said, ‘OK, if I were doing this sequence, it would be Tom in, say, 1989. It would be Tony Scott’s ‘Mission: Impossible.’ That’s who would have been directing the movie before Brian De Palma, you know, in that era,” McQuarrie said on the podcast. “We looked at Days of Thunder and we looked at the style of it, and we started thinking what would it look like if Tony Scott had shot this, and who would it have been? I looked back at who was the ingenue, who was the breakout star in 1989? And right around then was Mystic Pizza. And I was like, ‘Oh my God. Julia Roberts, a then-pre-Pretty Woman Julia Roberts, as this young woman.’” He continued, “The only way I could have seen doing the sequence justice [using de-aging] was to somehow convince Julia Roberts to come in and be this small role at the beginning of this story. And of course, as you’re conceptually going through it, you’re like, ‘Now all anybody’s going to be doing is thinking about the de-aging of Julia Roberts, and Esai (Morales) and Tom, and Henry Czerny.’”Costs also played into the decision. “I got the bill for de-aging those people before their salaries were even factored into it. And if you put two of them in a shot together, or three of them in a shot together, it would have been as expensive as the train by the time we were done. It was so … the force multiplier of — and the way we shoot scenes, and the fluidity, and the camera movement. And of course, that wouldn’t be the style of the movie in 1989. That wouldn’t make sense if you were shooting an ’89 ‘Mission’ like a 2023 ‘Mission.’”",

        "The moral complexity of Oppenheimer is matched only by its extraordinary technical achievements. Both are peerless. This is one more towering achievement for Christopher Nolan in a filmography overflowing with creative impetus. Moreover, Oppenheimer is a remarkable, multi-sensory reimagining all that a biopic can be. There’s precious little of convention here. Linear history is torn asunder in the name of art, with a patchwork narrative instead eliciting both insight and thematic urgency from a story that is broadly well known in the public consciousness. To say the film is nuclear would do only to scratch the surface. At a little over three hours in length, Oppenheimer has no right to boast so thrilling a pace as is here achieved. Theres simply no let up. Stirred up instead is an implausible unpredictability. This concerning events that occurred many decades past and are very well chronicled. This is the story of one man’s role in the still to occur destruction of humanity. It’s the birth of nuclear warfare in 65mm film and booming Dolby surround sound. Such details matter here, for this is true cinema. Nolan optimises every pixel of his screen in the name of delivering a veritable blitzkrieg of imagery: the objective, subjective, physical and metaphysical alike. Sound is integral to the appreciation. Chalkboard and siren strings wreak out a tension that scrapes through the film’s pulsating doomsday tones. Foley, too, becomes a vital soundtrack, with metronome ticks and stomping feeding bleeding into percussion and relentless drum beats. Then there’s the Trinity trial explosion itself. A deafening silence follows but more awful still is the applause.The film opens many years pre-detonation and also several after, with timelines zoning back and forth to an accordion motion. The forebodance of guilt arises early as we watch a young Robert J. Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) leave a poisoned apple for a disfavoured university professor, only to almost wipe out the Nobel Prize winning physicist Niels Bohr, who is played in stoic brief by Sir Kenneth Branagh. From here, we follow Oppenheimer’s rise to the upper echelons of contemporary theoretical physics, which he single-handedly introduces to a sluggish America. When talk of the weaponisation of nuclear power crosses the Atlantic from war torn Europe, it is to Oppenheimer US Army General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon) is compelled to turn. The film is based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning book ‘American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer’ by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin and learns much of its politics therein. Oppenheimer marks Murphy’s sixth turn in Nolan’s frame but only the first front and centre. The wait has been worth it. Simply put, Murphy has never been better. It’s an all encompassing performance and straddler of seemingly endless facets of personality. In his startling blue eyes, Murphy captures the beautiful mind, the thinker, the comic, the philanderer, the dreamer, the doom monger and so many more. Some of this sparks into sensory reality, through intercut illustration and overwhelming audible interruption. Most is in the delivery of dulcet dialogue and impeccable physical performance. There are many scenes to well showcase Murphy’s skill here but few hit home like that in which a moment of triumph is unsettled by existential self-questioning and the horrific realisation of guilt. It is the apex of how best a director might unite editing, performance and cinematography to compel.No man is an island, however, and Murphy’s film carrying is well met in an astonishingly starry ensemble. Robert Downey Jr. gifts Nolan his best work in years as Machiavellian businessman Lewis Strauss, with Emily Blunt no less sensational as Oppenheimer’s disparaging, often drunk, wife Kitty. In more fleeting appearances, the likes of Florence Pugh, Benny Safdie, Rami Malek and Gary Oldman do much to prove indefinitely that there is no such thing as a small part. It is a testament to Nolan’s magnetism as a director that such talent can coalesce upon a single film but, equally, the star wattage here does much to power Oppenheimer’s epic proportions. It feels important, it feels like a moment. What’s more, this is not a moment that exists solely in the cinema. Oppenheimer is that rare entity that not only lingers in the viewer’s mind but consumes it. A running through line of the film is the notion that a door once opened cannot be shut: ‘this is not a weapon, this is a new world.’ In opening a door into Oppenheimer’s own troubled psyche, Nolan unleashes a maelstrom of thought provocation. It is no passing gesture that sees the film’s opening lines recall the Promethean mythology. If Frankenstein was Mary Shelley’s once modern Prometheus, Oppenheimer is, to Nolan, the last century’s successor. This is a biopic of such literary grandeur. Believe the hype. Find the biggest screen around. Don’t miss it.",

      description:"Get ready to join the beloved Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles in their latest animated escapade, “TMNT: Mutant Mayhem”! Directed by Jeff Rowe, this action-packed film bursts onto the screen with a visually stunning animation style. While some may draw comparisons to Sony’s Spider-Verse films, “TMNT Mutant Mayhem” has its own signature flair, making it stand out in comparison to other animated films. This movie is a thrill as the turtles’ begin their heroic journey to win the hearts of New Yorkers and be accepted as normal teenagers. Their journey takes an unexpected turn when they find themselves facing off against a mysterious crime syndicate and an army of menacing mutants. This movie is a fun adventure that’s filled with pop cultural references, surprisingly contemporary slang, and an amazing rap music soundtrack that’ll keep your head nodding from sta The animation in “TMNT: Mutant Mayhem” is really on point! Sure, some folks might compare it to the Spider-verse movies, but honestly, it’s got its own unique visual flair that I totally dug. The movie is a colorful rollercoaster of action, and I was here for it! There are moments early in the film that show off the movie’s dedication to having a great story. That great story helps ease you into the animation style and introduces us to our characters.The pop culture references and contemporary slang had me cracking up! The turtles using iPhones and even airdropping info with April was both hilarious and oddly relatable. I mean, who doesn’t love a good tech-savvy turtle? The characters all look and sound great and do a good job of modernizing these old characters. They look good, they sound good, and they have great taste in music. The characters get great-looking updates to go along with their new animation, especially April O’Neil and Baxter Stockman.",

      description:"In the final trailer for the movie, we see Jaime fully embrace his newfound Blue Beetle powers. When it comes to superhero movies, origin stories like this, tend to be the most fun and intriguing to watch. In the trailer, we get similarities to Shazam! When Billy Batson had to get used to his powers, in a really fun way. They were both not ready for these types of powers, but they were also really excited to be taking them on. As the trailer suggests, power like this becomes something many people will pursue. Jaime will be chased down by villain Victoria Kord, played by the fantastic Susan Sarandon.The trailer really stands out, because it shows that the Blue Beetle is more powerful than some superhero fans might be used to. I feel like these kinds of powers are always going to make for a great movie. Jaime can literally imagine any weapon he wants, and the Blue Beetle will make it happen! You even can watch some great examples in the trailer. Blue Beetle promises a ton of action and that could very well mark the beginning of an Iron Man type era for the DC universe. What’s extremely positive with this trailer though, is how DC has stepped up on the CGI once more. After The Flash, fans were rightfully left divided by the CGI in the movie. Blue Beetle looks like things are back on track now in that regardHow will Jaime survive this? How will he protect his family, and will he keep the power of the Blue Beetle? All these questions will be answered in August.",

      description:"Sure, the directing work of Gareth Edwards on Godzilla and Monsters got the attention of Sci-Fi fans across the world, however, what gained their complete trust was his addition to a galaxy, far, far away, with a little movie called Rogue One. With this Star Wars entry he completely changed how we saw this iconic franchise in a very realistic, and gritty way, with a dose of unforgettable nostalgia, especially in those claustrophobic final 10 minutes (You know exactly what I’m talking about right?). So with all of this in mind, and when the trailer dropped for The Creator, confirming that Gareth Edwards was back with another Sci-Fi epic, I was immediately very interested to see his next project!In a world where a war wages between humans and AI, this trailer shows us the character of Joshua (John David Washington), a driven person who wants to do everything within his power to stop this savage war, and it seems that the answer to that lies with the AI super weapon Alphie. After taking on the rewinding world of Christopher Nolan’s Tenet, this seems like the perfect follow-up movie for actor John David Washington, a genre that he is used to, and I believe that he will absolutely smash this role.In the trailer alone we see a brutal world – just take a look at all of those robots getting crushed in some sort of junkyard – that harks at the grimness of District 9, combined with the smooth-looking cinematic feel of Rogue One. For me, as far as Sci-Fi combinations go, it just doesn’t get much better than that. Not forgetting to mention that the attention to detail on how the vast array of robots look is on another level. Gareth Edwards has “created” an astonishing world, with a mix-up of CGI and realistic-looking shots, and with an AI story that feels a little bit close to home, he is giving us a scarily relevant plot. In Terminator 2: Judgment Day a world like that being created so soon didn’t seem possible to me, but in the trailer for The Creator, Gareth Edwards is making us feel like it’s just around the corner, and that’s terrifying. “This is a fight for our very existence” echoes the trailer, a tease that this film will be nothing short of astonishing.",

      description:"Let me tell you what I thought about The Horror of Dolores Roach. after an unjust 16-year prison sentence, Dolores Roach (played by the Fabulous Justina Machado) returns to a gentrified Washington Heights, where she tries to assimilate back into society.  She reunites with an old stoner friend, Luis, who lets her live and work as a masseuse in the basement under his empanada shop. She quickly becomes known as “Magic Hands” for her skills – only to find out that she also has “killer hands”. From the start of the series, you are captured by the action of the characters, the wildness of uptown NYC streets, and the humor and horror of it all. As a native New Yorker, I can relate to many of the characters in the film just trying to survive in this bustling city. The darkness of The Horror of Dolores Roach was delightfully reminiscent of Sweeney Todd with the empanada shop selling a new specialty empanada that customers just can’t resist! Can you say Meat pies con sabor? The actors were so endearing, especially the phenomenal Justina Machado, who I’ve loved since Six Feet Under back in the day. Some new faces such as Alejandro Hernandez (Luis) Kita Updike (Nellie) along with familiar faces like Judy Reyes, Jessica Pimentel and Marc Macon, and the great Cyndi Lauper were all part of this wonderful casting. This show absolutely had me clapping, laughing out loud, and screaming at the TV. It is so enjoyable and fun for horror fans and non-horror fans alike. Based on the play and scripted podcast by Aaron Mark, which I have not listened to… yet, I binged through all 8 episodes and hoping for a second season.THE BAD ",

      description:"When James Gunn announced that he was re-starting the entire Superman storyline, with a brand-new Superman movie called Superman Legacy, the first question that everyone obviously had in mind was “Who is going to replace Henry Cavill?” Thankfully, fans didn’t have to wait too long, because he recently announced that David Corenswet will be taking on this Superman Legacy casting in the iconic role, and at the same time he also confirmed that Rachel Brosnahan would be playing Clark Kent’s love interest, Lois Lane! With David, he has starred in projects such as Pearl and We Own This City, and in a similar vein to say Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker, James Gunn is clearly giving us a character that viewers won’t be able to compare to too many other characters or franchises, and in movie history, this idea always works extremely well. For Rachel, viewers would have seen her in her fantastic role as Miriam ‘Midge’ Maisel in The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, a show which shows she can easily take on the character of Lois Lane, with a fresh approach! When it comes to cinema history, it doesn’t get much bigger than Superman, and I’m really excited to see how they’ll tackle these fantastic characters.With the highly anticipated announcement of the two leads now confirmed, what fans have now been wondering, is “Who else will feature in the movie?” and, after giving followers just a tiny bit of time to accept the first bit of huge casting news, James Gunn has now added even more actors, to an already impressive line-up. We’ve got Anthony Carrigan (Barry) taking on the role of Rex Mason, and Isabela Merced (Dora and the Lost City of Gold) as Hawkgirl just to start with. Then, we’ve got a James Gunn regular, Nathan Fillion (Suicide Squad) cast as Guy Gardner, and Edi Gathegi (X-Men: First Class) as Mister Terrific. Ultimately, James Gunn has given us some out-of-this-world casting news for Superman: Legacy, and what’s more exciting, is that it shows that the creative process for the movie is in full swing, and James Gunn is clearly very eager to get it done. Bring it on.",

      description:"We have our very first look at the upcoming Marvel Studios film The Marvels from the D23 Expo. The Marvels is set for release on July 28, 2023, and will feature Brie Larson, Iman Vellani, Teyonah Parris, and Samuel L. Jackson. This will serve as the sequel to Captain Marvel and Marvel has been very secretive about its plot. As of now, we know relatively nothing about the film; however, we do know it will feature a team of superpowered women known as “The Marvels.” D23 has given us our first look at The Marvels and several other projects. The footage was taken by fans in attendance at D23 and features clips and behind-the-scenes insights into the film. The film is described as “Full comic book madness” and we get to see a bit of that in the footage. The project is currently in production and is on track to hit its July 28, 2023 release date. No word on the plot or any significant details; however, this first look should be enough to satisfy fans until we learn more. You can see the entire sizzle reel from the D23 Expo below:I think the footage from The Marvels is great. Some of it was from past projects like Wandavision, Captain Marvel, and Ms. Marvel, but I think there is some new stuff in there. Marvel is usually pretty secretive about their projects and The Marvels is no exception. We have very little information about the film and even the rumor mill is pretty quiet. Given the Skrulls’ involvement in Captain Marvel, it’s likely that The Marvels could tie into the upcoming series Secret Wars with Samuel L. Jackson and Ben Mendelsohn. That’s simply conjecturing but it makes sense given what we know. It’s also possible that The Marvels could expand the MCU Cosmic universe seeing that Captain Marvel as a character spends most of her time in space. Ms. Marvel and Monica Rambeau are more terrestrial characters but this could be their chance to see the greater universe. Hopefully, we’ll get more information on the film in the coming months, but you can catch The Marvels when it hits theaters on July 28, 2023.",

      images:"https://www.themovieblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/featured-752x440.jpg.webp",
      description:"Miles and Peter can both coexist in Sony’s Spider-Verse movies’ universe. Especially given that the DCU is going to do something similar with Batman. In James Gunn’s new DCU, there will be an Elseworlds version of Batman played by Robert Pattinson in The Batman. This franchise will focus on a younger Batman learning to be a crime fighter. But Gunn has also announced The Brave And The Bold which will be in-canon and see a much older and experienced Batman, learning to be a father to his son as Robin. Given that the DCU can feature two versions of the same character, so can Sony’s Spider-Verse movies. Leaving Tom Holland’s Spider-Man movies out of it, given that they are clearly in the MCU, Sony can retroactively create their own shared universe of Spider-Man characters. Since they’ve already set up a universe with multiple Spider-villains who all have origin stories independent of Spider-Man, it wouldn’t be difficult to make them the villains as a continuation to their previous Andrew Garfield Spider-Man franchise. To start with, anyways.Miles Morales’ Spider-Man franchise could be the brand new universe where we see a younger Spider-Man build his own career as the prime Spider-Man of this universe. Along with his own villains, conflicts both internal and external and side characters who could then spin-off into their own adventure. Potentially. Essentially a brand new rebooted Spider-Man franchise, similar to Maguire’s and Garfield’s. This way Sony gets to do with a new Spider-Man what the MCU has done with Holland’s Spider-Man movie While the way to unite all these separate, seemingly standalone villain movies, would be to bring back an older Spider-Man who has to team up with some of them as anti-heroes, and fight against others as full-on villains. There were already talks of Tobey or Andrew returning to their own Spider-Man franchises after their appearances in Spider-Man: No Way Home. So it would be the perfect way to bring Garfield back and unite these villains as being a part of his universe Also, it would be the first time we get an older Spider-Man later on in life, with the burdens of adulthood adding new layers to the character in live-action. Seeing how popular Peter B. Parker’s character was in Into The Spider-Verse, a similar one could be just as successful in live-action. Especially if the two franchises cross streams and Garfield’s Spider-Man acts as a mentor to a live-action Spider-Man, similar to Into The Spider-Verse What do you think of this idea of Sony’s Spider-Verse movies?

      description:"Apple has now opened applications for Vision Pro developer kits, which it’s sending out to app developers in effort to kickstart its first XR-specific App Store.Vision Pro is set to launch sometime in early 2024, coming part and parcel with a load of first-party apps originally developed for iPad. This includes basic things like Safari, Photos, Music, Messages, and even an avatar support for FacetimApple has been fairly mum on its list of third-party apps, listing only a few during its WWDC unveiling in June, including Word, Excel, Teams, Disney+, Zoom, WebEX, and Rec Room, its only VR game to be featured during the keynote. Apple says the dev kit also includes help setting up the device and onboarding, check-ins with Apple experts for UI design and development guidance, and two additional code-level support requests so Apple can help troubleshoot issuLike with many hardware developer kits, there are some fairly stringent (if not entirely standard) caveats. The Vision Pro dev kit needs to be returned upon request, and also has to be stored in a private, secure workspace that unauthorized persons don’t have access to view, handle, or use. The dev kit also needs to be passcode protected and never left unattended, or removed from its home address without Apple’s prior written consenAgain, that’s all pretty standard stuff so developers don’t lose, leak, or strip the headset down to its component parts for the glee of XR publications everywhere. We’ll likely be waiting for that last bit when it finally launches sometime in early 2024.",

      description:"Apple for years has made user privacy a focus for its App Store, with rules around data collection, plus requirements around app labeling, anti-tracking measures and the more private “Sign in with Apple” option. Now, Apple will begin to require that developers explain why they need access to select data, under some circumstances, with a new policy designed to crack down on the misuse of APIs.APIs, or Application Programming Interfaces, are used by developers to extract and exchange data. In the context of the new App Store rule, Apple explains that some APIs can be missed by developers to collect data about users’ devices through “fingerprinting.” That means the APIs are being used to access certain device signals for the purpose of identifying the device or the user. Apple doesn’t allow fingerprinting, even if the user has given the app permission to track themAs The New York Times reported in 2019, the use of this largely invisible method of user and device tracking was on the rise in the ad industry in response to the increased privacy protections companies like Apple and others, such as Mozilla, had implemented over the years. Those changes made it more difficult for advertisers to use more traditional tracking methods, like cookies or pixels embedded in social media buttons, for instance, the report explained. And with the launch of Apple’s App Tracking Transparency in 2021, the use of fingerprinting was prohibited, but without additional measures to fully police itThat is starting to change with the new app developer requirementNow, when developers want to access certain APIs they will need to provide a reason. Apple explains developers will need to select from one or more of the “approved reasons” that explain how their app will use the API, and then the app can only use the API for those stated purposes. Among the APIs impacted are those around file timestamps, disk space, system boot time, active keyboard and user defaultsThe requirement will go into effect in fall 2023, Apple says. Developers who upload an app or an app update to the App Store after that point without providing a reason for their use of the API will be informed they need to add the approved reason to their app’s privacy manifest before resubmitting. This also extends to third-party SDKs (software development kits) their app is usingThen, in spring 2024, apps and app updates that don’t include a reason will be rejected.",

      images:"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Austin-Russell.jpg?w=1390&crop=1",
      description:"Austin Russell is on quite a run The 28-year-old founder and CEO of Luminar, which develops vision-based lidar and machine perception technologies primarily for self-driving cars, told The Wall Street Journal earlier today that he is buying an 82% stake in Forbes Global Media Holdings in a deal that values the company at nearly $800 million.  According to the WSJ, Russell’s stake includes the remaining portion of the company owned by its namesake family, which sold 95% of the company to the Hong Kong-based investor group Integrated Whale Media back in 2014. Forbes was essentially on sale from the moment it called off its merger with a special-purpose acquisition company in June of last year, after the market soured and investors lost their appetite for SPACs.   Luminar itself had better timing; it went public via a SPAC merger in 2021 when retail investors were still clamoring for shares in mobility tech companies. Still, by the time Forbes was calling off its own SPAC plans, nearly every mobility SPAC was trading below its offering price, and Luminar has not been immune to the broader downturn. Valued at $3.4 billion when it hit Wall Street, its market cap is now roughly $2 billion. Just three days ago it reported slightly wider than expected losses.  Some retail investors might not be so happy about its performance, even while Russell told the Silicon Valley Business Journal last year that he had no regrets about the SPAC. (From his perspective, the alternative would have been to potentially run out of money, as private market investors began to snap shut their checkbooks.)  Others might find it concerning that Russell — described by Forbes itself in 2021 as the world’s youngest self-made billionaire — will soon be directing some of his attention elsewhere.  Shareholders — and Luminar employees — may also find the acquisition confusing.  While it has become fashionable to dabble with more than one company at once (Elon Musk, Jack Dorsey), as well as to be a billionaire owner of a media company (Jeff Bezos, Laurene Powell Jobs, Marc Benioff), buying Forbes when so many outlets are fighting for survival bucks conventional wisdom.   Then again, Russell has been focused on Luminar since 2012, when he dropped out of Stanford to start the company, aided by a $100,000 grant from renowned investor Peter Thiel. (The Thiel Fellowship program, founded in 2011, continues to give $100,000 to select students who are eager to spend two years on their idea instead of “sitting in a classroom.”)  Russell has enjoyed the fruits of his work in the ensuing years. He purchased an $83 million Los Angeles spread in 2021 that has since been featured in the hit show “Succession.” He also reportedly paid another $10.6 million for a 13,000-square-foot mansion in Winter Park, Florida, near Luminar’s Orlando headquarters. But after spending his entire career focused on Luminar, he could well be looking to alter how he invests his time.  As Y Combinator’s Paul Graham once said as he expressed his distaste for funding founders who are especially young, sometimes the worse thing that can happen to a person is that his or her startup succeeds straightaway.  Said Graham: “[I]f you start a successful startup, like, the footloose and fancy-free days of your life are over. You’re working for that company.”   In a statement to the WSJ, Russell said simply of his motivations that: “Forbes is something I had always looked up to as a brand and as a media empire.” He also told the outlet that he doesn’t plan to get involved in Forbes’s day-to-day operations but that he wants to both grow the outfit and emphasize “philanthropy” within the business.  TechCrunch reached out to Russell a bit ago; we were referred to a press release about the acquisition and told Russell has no further comment for now.",

      description:"Tesla exaggerated the range estimates for its EVs for years, prompting owners to flood its service center over concerns that their vehicles needed service, according to a new detailed Reuters report. The investigation, citing anonymous sources and industry experts, found that the directive to use algorithms to give rosier range numbers came from CEO Elon Musk.As sales exploded, service requests also grew. To thwart the influx of requests and help keep costs in check, Tesla created a special “diversion team” dedicated to handle so-called “range cases” — meaning owners complaining of lower ranges than expectedDiversion team members were trained to tell owners that the EPA-approved range estimates were just a prediction. They would also provide tips to customers on how to extend range. The end goal? To cancel those appointments, which would save the company as much as $1,000 a visit, the Reuters investigation foundIt should be noted that Reuters reported that it is unable to determine whether Tesla still uses algorithms that boost in-dash range estimatesTesla has been caught falsely advertising its range estimates before. As the report noted, South Korea regulators fined Tesla earlier this year $2.1 million for falsely advertising driving ranges on its local website between August 2019 and December 2022. The Korea Fair Trade Commission also found that Tesla failed to inform owners that cold weather can reduce its cars’ range. The commission cited tests showing Tesla cars lost up to 50.5% of the company’s claimed ranges in cold weatherIn the U.S., Tesla has so far avoided fines by regulators. But since the 2020 model year, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has required Tesla to reduce the range estimates the automaker wanted to use in advertising by an average of 3%One of the nagging problems with range estimates is their variability, which allows some automakers to push the boundaries of the system. While the EPA does review and approve those estimates, it allows automakers to use one of two methods to reach those figures: use a standard formula that converts fuel economy results, or conduct additional tests to come up with their own range estimate. Tesla has always done the latter, which gives far better numbers.",

Despite OnlyFans’ resounding success, being CEO of the platform is a particularly difficult job. As changing credit card company policies and global legislation make it more and more difficult for online sex workers to make a living, OnlyFans must contend with these same obstacles.

Though this decision was eventually reversed, creators won’t soon forget that moment of crisis, when it seemed that they were doomed to once again suffer the financial consequences of being deplatformed.When asked at TechCrunch Disrupt whether or not adult creators can expect to still be on OnlyFans in five years, Gan said yes. However, both Gan and Blair ducked questions about how much of OnlyFans’ revenue is driven by adult creators, as the company has continuously pushed its safe-for-work offerings like OFTVAs she announces her departure from OnlyFans, Gan has also revealed her next venture.

      description:"When it’s released, React 18 will include out-of-the-box improvements (like automatic batching), new APIs (like startTransition), and a new streaming server renderer with built-in support for React.lazy.These features are possible thanks to a new opt-in mechanism we’re adding in React 18. It’s called “concurrent rendering” and it lets React prepare multiple versions of the UI at the same time. This change is mostly behind-the-scenes, but it unlocks new possibilities to improve both real and perceived performance of your app.If you’ve been following our research into the future of React (we don’t expect you to!), you might have heard of something called “concurrent mode” or that it might break your app. In response to this feedback from the community, we’ve redesigned the upgrade strategy for gradual adoption. Instead of an all-or-nothing “mode”, concurrent rendering will only be enabled for updates triggered by one of the new features. In practice, this means you will be able to adopt React 18 without rewrites and try the new features at your own pace. Since concurrency in React 18 is opt-in, there are no significant out-of-the-box breaking changes to component behavior. You can upgrade to React 18 with minimal or no changes to your application code, with a level of effort comparable to a typical major React release. Based on our experience converting several apps to React 18, we expect that many users will be able to upgrade within a single afternoon.We successfully shipped concurrent features to tens of thousands of components at Facebook, and in our experience, we’ve found that most React components “just work” without additional changes. We’re committed to making sure this is a smooth upgrade for the entire community, so today we’re announcing the React 18 Working Group.Everyone can read the discussions in the React 18 Working Group repo. Because we expect an initial surge of interest in the Working Group, only invited members will be allowed to create or comment on threads. However, the threads are fully visible to the public, so everyone has access to the same information. We believe this is a good compromise between creating a productive environment for working group members, while maintaining transparency with the wider community  As always, you can submit bug reports, questions, and general feedback to our issue tracker.

Now we’ve learned of the first details of the studio’s next project.Following the launch of several non-VR games, Twisted Pixel Games in recent years has become largely focused on VR. The studio has built several VR games, exclusively published by Oculus Studios, for the Rift, Go, and Quest headsets. The most recent being Path of the Warrior (2019) for Quest and RiftAfter working closely with Twisted Pixel under Oculus Studios, it was announced late last year that Meta had acquired the studio, along with several othersConsidering that we haven’t seen any new release or even game announcement from Twisted Pixel since late 2019, it wasn’t clear if the studio had remained properly intact, or if it had been absorbed into the Meta mothership and scattered to the windBut now we have our first glimpse of an answer. According to job postings published this year, the studio has been seeking to fill various roles to work on an “unannounced VR game using the Unreal Engine.Considering Meta’s priorities at this moment, it’s almost certain the game will be built for standalone Quest headsets only.The mention of Unreal Engine (specifically UE4, as noted in some listings) is certainly interesting. There’s a very small handful of Quest games that have been built with Unreal Engine. The other, more popular choice by far, is Unity, which is largely thought to scale better to the low-end hardware of the Quest headsets; not to mention it’s almost always the first to get the latest Quest developer tools from Meta.Other job listings for Twisted Pixel mention “experience developing a multiplayer networked game” among the ‘Preferred Qualifications’ of candidates, which gives a strong indication the next game from the studio will be built with some kind of multiplayer functionaliConsidering the timing of the studio’s acquisition announcement, we’d guess that Twisted Pixel is actively building a VR game that’s primarily targeting to launch with Quest 3, or shortly thereafter (though will probably be backwards compatible with Quest 2 as well). With Quest 3 rapidly approaching, we should learn more about the studio’s upcoming game in due time.",

      description:"Kettlebells can be confusing for some people because of the handle, but they also provide a lot of variety that can make it easier to learn or modify exercises. Unlike barbell cleans (or even the kettlebell clean), a kettlebell goblet clean helps you train explosive leg drive with minimal upper body movement. With most clean exercises, you have to “catch” the bell or bar in what’s called the rack position (resting on your arm and upper chest). This is the same position as barbell front squats, only, instead of starting with the bar in position, you need to catch it during the lift The kettlebell goblet clean doesn’t require finishing in the rack, which is what makes it difficult for some and can lead to injury. Whenever you hear the term “goblet,” it means you’ll hold the KB with both hands in front of your chest Here’s what makes this movement so effective: taking the kettlebell from the floor to the goblet position only requires relaxing your grip. That’s it. You won’t need to bang up your wrists and forearms for weeks while you learn it This makes it an ideal move for beginners. You’ll be on your way to mastering the lift your first day. And you’ll learn how to safely get a heavy bell into the starting position for goblet squats without tweaking your lower back. Win-win The entire movement is great for building lower-body explosiveness that will strengthen your hamstrings and glutes. As you get better, you can try “catching” a single kettlebell or progress to a double-kettlebell clean. Or, you can just keep adding weight and never have to worry about the “catch” aspect. The variety is part of what makes the exercise so effective. ",

      description:"Some things you can’t debate, such as whether it’s a crime to hide a raisin cookie in a batch of chocolate chips. Other acts are a little less certain. And, when it comes to exercise movement, there’s no shortage of disagreement about what movements are safe and which should be limited. Squats are one of the most controversial exercises. Some people suggest they are the best movement (period), whereas others – most notably, respected coach Mike Boyle – suggest they are oftentimes abused and unnecessary. If you want to see what this looks like on your own body, find a mirror and it’s easy to assess. Turn sideways to the mirror and then slowly lower into a bodyweight squat. As you reach the bottom of the squat, watch your lower back. If you’re like most people, you’ll see this area slowly “wink” as you go deeperThis rounding of the spine, called spinal flexion, isn’t inherently dangerous. Our spines are made to flex, extend, and rotate as human beings. That’s why you likely don’t need to worry about this rounding during movements like that bodyweight squat. So, what’s the big deal? Rounding with no weight on your back is not much of a problem. But, once you start adding flexion with weight on your back – and doing it for many reps – such as during a heavy back squat, that’s when the story changesMost spine experts consider rounding your low back with load (such as a barbell) to be a risk for your lumbar spine, which means you’re at higher risk of disk injury and back pain.Here’s why: Between each bone segment (the vertebrae) of your spine is a gel-filled disk that helps absorb shock. This means when there’s weight on your back, you can transfer it safely throughout your spine.When you load your spine, you create a compression force that pushes the vertebrae together and squeezes the intervertebral disks. This isn’t dangerous if you have a healthy spine. (Fun fact: your spine is quite resilient to compression.)The issue is when you compress and flex your spine at the same time. This combination of load and flexion increases another force (shear) on your spine. And shear plus compression could increase your chance of injury.",

      description:"This is a drill that just about every one of our new clients has in their initial warm-ups. It’s absolutely essential to be able to get the arms overhead without compensation in the lower back or neck, and this drill both assesses and trains that quality. If you can’t pass this with flying colors, you really aren’t ready for overhead pressing or a host of other exercises that require great overhead shoulder function. This is a great catch-all mobility drill that I like to include an “integrate everything” strategy at the end of a warm-up. You train multiple hip mobility qualities and open up your thoracic spine (upper back) on the reaching component of the movement. You have to work hard to resist both rotation and extension (arching) of your lower back, and you also build some hip and upper back mobility in the process. What’s not to love? This movement is awesome but be warned: it really sucks to perform. But, as a general rule of thumb, everyone needs a little “suck” in their training programs if they want to make progress. This exercise trains a lot of athletic qualities that can hide as reasons why you don’t become stronger – single-leg strength, core stability, upper body mobility – while still giving you enough loading to put some mass on your lower body. How to do it: Work this in for sets of 4-8 reps. You can do this early in the session in place of squatting for variety, or if you’re unable to squat because of injuries or mobility restrictions. You can also try it out for higher reps as a first assistance exercise after you squat or deadlift. ",

      description:"“I’d argue that a lot of what people call ‘lack of mobility’ can be attributed not to lack of flexibility but to lack of stability, which you can establish through coaching tension,” says Tony Gentilcore, owner of CORE, a small-group training facility in Boston.Here’s what he means. Let’s say you’re having trouble staying upright when you squat. Your torso leans forward as you descend. Lots of people will blame that on a lack of mobility in their thoracic spine (upper back). But there’s a good chance that what’s actually to blame is your core. You’re not stable enough in your midsection to descend as far as you should. If you learn how to create more tension in your core, then suddenly the “mobility issue” goes awayHere’s how it works. If you’re an experienced lifter, perhaps you’re familiar with the terms “kinetic chain” and “energy leaks.” If not, here’s a quick primerThe kinetic chain refers to the body’s joints (ankle, knee, hip, shoulder, etc.) working together. Think of your body as a cohesive unit. When you walk, for instance, it’s just not your legs doing the work. Anyone that’s ever had a back injury knows this all too well because even the simplest (seemingly unrelated) movements can cause painAn energy leak occurs when there’s insufficient stiffness (a.k.a. tension) around one of those jointsSo let’s say you’re performing a back squat and your knees cave inward. That’s an energy leak. And it’s a problem because, not only does that leak put stress on the joints, it also fosters a muscle imbalance. When your knees cave in, your body asks the surrounding muscles to re-center your knee. Over time, you’re strengthening one set of muscles at the expense of another. (You’re also burning metabolic fuel that could otherwise be put toward another rep.Maybe that’s something you can get away with if you only ever use light resistance when you train. But as the weight gets heavier, the risk gets bigger“For advanced guys, you might have 400-500 pounds on your back,” says strength coach Jason Ferruggia. “So to minimize injury risk, you’ve got to maintain full-body tension throughout the set.What does that mean? When you think of weightlifting technique, you usually just think about the muscles you’re working. But that’s just part of the story. You need to prepare your entire body for a lift, and, oftentimes, it’s the muscles you wouldn’t even think aboutStaying with the squat example, most people are worried about their knees or their back (or both). But creating “full-body tension” often times starts in neither of those two places. You’ll begin with your grip on the bar and then focus on your breathing and abs, which is what actually protects your back from injuryWhen you take a big belly breath (think about filling your stomach with air so that if you have a belt around your natural waist you would feel it become tight), it creates a natural lifting belt that protects your spine. This is known as bracing your torso. (Here’s a story that explains how it works and how to do it. You can skip down to the section “The Problem: Incorrect Breathing” if you want to see it straight away.So in this case, tension is protective. Your grip creates tension that sends a signal to your brain saying, “I’m about to lift heavy weight.” That’s important. If you then “pull” your elbows down and back (imagine someone’s hands trying to push your elbows up and you have to resist against them), you’ll engage your lats, which also protect your spine. Then, when you take your belly breath, you add the final piece of full body tension, which will protect your spine. This type of approach can prevent an energy leak that causes your form to break down and injury to occurJust as tension protects you when you squat, it keeps you safer when you perform other exercises. A shoulder that’s engaged is less likely to wind up in an unnatural position when you overhead press. Having your torso firmly braced will help protect your lower back when you deadliftAs mentioned earlier, the heavier of a weight you use, the more important weightlifting technique and proper tension becomes. The same is true for the number of reps—the more you perform, the more challenging it is“Every rep beyond 5 or 6 or so becomes increasingly more difficult to do, so you open yourself up to more injury risk,” Ferruggia says. “That’s why I like low reps on the big lifts. It’s really hard to maintain that tension while maintaining good form. So a lot of times people say beginners should do high reps. No, it’s the opposite.",

      description:"It’s a process. One that starts fast when you first begin training, and then inevitably slows down for everyone. And yet that slowed progress doesn’t have to be the “no progress” experienced by many. Whether you’ve been lifting for 10 days or 10 years, three rules can help make the difference between a “muscle building workout” that turns you into a gainer, as opposed to the one that only makes you a gawker. Do you see progress on your own body, or helplessly look at others and wonder why they have more success While genetics inevitable do make a difference, your genetics are not preventing you from adding on pounds of muscle. There are three rules of a muscle building workout that you must respect if you want to transformation your body Rule #1: Building muscle is a science. Your best bet is to follow the basic principles of hypertrophy (more on this in a moment) to increase your likelihood of seeing results from your muscle building workout. You can build muscle in many ways, but some approaches will work better than others and make a big different in the long run Rule #2: Every body is different. Two people can be on the exact same program and experience different results. Some can get jacked on bodyweight movements, other have long, lean defined muscles after some TLC from the dumbbells. This is an important reminder for copycat behaviors. You can choose to follow the practices of the biggest guy or fittest female in the gym, but what works for them might not be the best for your body or could very well violate rule number one. Which leads to Rule #3: Knowledge is not set in stone. Science is an ongoing process, and new studies are guaranteed to do one thing — provide us with new questions to ask. Use rules one and two to help build the best muscle building workout for your body, but remember we’re always learning and improving our understanding of what works best Now that we’re on the same page and have exhausted any potential excuses, here’s what we know can turn you into a muscle-building machine, even if mom and dad never flexed a moment in their life.",

      description:"This process is called bomb calorimetry. First, you place an ingredient in a sealed stainless steel container surrounded by water. Then, heat is applied to the food until it burns. This chemical reaction generates a ton of heat and slowly heats the surrounding water. Scientists then measure how high the temperature of the water rises to calculate the number of calories in the food When you eat protein, up to 30 percent of the calories can be burned. In the example above, if you ate 100 calories of protein, roughly 70 calories would hit your body because 30 calories would be burned as a result of the protein’s high TEF.Although accurate, this process is slowly losing favor. Today, most calories listed by the USDA and FDA are calculated in a different way. Instead of burning the food, the total amount of calories are determined by adding up the calories provided by the individual components of the food. This means determining the amount of energy from the protein, carbohydrates, fat, and alcohol.  This method works because the calories in a gram of protein, carbohydrates, fat, and alcohol remain constant. Each macronutrient has the following caloric values: In other words, the greater the TEF, the more this will influence the “calories out” portion of the calories in minus calories out equation (because not all of those calories will end up in your body and stored). Comparatively, carbs have a TEF of just 5 to 10  percent, and fat is usually around 3 to 5 percent.",

      description:"That’s not to say that weight training doesn’t burn a lot of calories while you’re training. Research from Christopher Scott suggests that an 8-minute high-intensity circuit can burn up to 250 calories. And that’s just 8 minutes, which shows you how many calories you might be burning if you can potentially double that amount from the afterburn.  Research also suggests that building muscle improves your insulin sensitivity, which means you process carbs more efficiently and you lessen the likelihood of diabetes. That’s a fancy way of saying more muscle changes the way that your body reacts to food. That’s because your muscles need the energy to repair, maintain, or grow So, the more muscle you add, the more your body processes food and calories differently and makes it less likely that what you eat will be stored as fat. From the Born Fitness Community: “I’ve always thought that adding muscle speeds up your metabolism. But then I read this isn’t correct. So what’s the truth: Does increasing your muscle mass really increase your metabolism?” -Phil, Vancou There are seemingly two main camps that disagree about the relationship between muscle and metabolism. On one side, some people believe that build more muscle means your metabolism works at a much higher rate and burns more. On the other side, you have people who suggest muscle does not burn that many calories, so its impact on your daily calorie burn is minimal.",

      description:"Yes, sugar can play an indirect role in both. But, data and research don’t align to suggest that both diseases are driven by sugar. Over the last 40 years, our sugar consumption has shifted from 20.8 teaspoons of sugar per day in the 1970s to about 23 teaspoons of sugar per day. Both numbers are too high, but the ~2.2 teaspoons increase is only about 32 added extra calories. Again, too much sugar, but the increase in sugar is not what’s driving obesity After all, according to USDA data, calorie consumption has increased by anywhere from 600 to 700 calories over the same time period. For reference, the consumption of fats and oils jumped from 52 pounds per year (per person) in the 1970s to 82 pounds per year more recently The problem with obesity is too many calories. And that is a complicated problem that includes many factors such as food availability, hyper-palatable foods (think fat, salty, and sweet combined), psychological factors, social factors, and genetics Can sugar potentially make you desire to eat more? Yes. But, as you’ll find out, the poison is in the dose and the source. It’s not one or the other The same goes for diabetes. Many people believe that sugar causes diabetes. In reality, it’s excess body fat that triggers the disease. If you have too much body fat, then it creates insulin resistance, which means your body’s natural glucose control breaks and you start storing and processing sugar differently. That’s what leads to prediabetes and, ultimately, diabetes. Sugar is not toxic. And, it’s not the primary cause of obesi Those are the first two things you need to know when considering if sugar is bad. After all, your body is perfectly designed to metabolize sugar. When you eat carbohydrates (any carbohydrates, vegetables included) your body eventually breaks them down into glucose (AKA sugar) So, the idea that sugar is bad when your body is designed to use it and convert it into energy just doesn’t make sense Now, that’s not to say that too much sugar can’t be a problem. It can, but understanding your limits can make your diet a lot less stressful and a lot more delicious. Let’s dig in.",

      description:"Now, that’s not to say bodyweight strength is the key to a long life. Many factors will play into the full picture of your health. But, building more bodyweight strength is a good predictor of longevity, and a great foundation for a strong body that can help you live a better, healthier life.  If you want to invest in your body, you don’t need a fully stocked gym, or even minimal equipment like a barbell or dumbbells, to see some incredible results. That’s because your body does NOT need weights to change; it requires resistance. Your bodyweight can be used to create an amazingly effective workout that leads to a total body transformation And bodyweight training isn’t just for beginners. You can take advantage of the benefits of bodyweight training no matter how many years you’ve spent in the gym. If you’re looking for a place to start — or a new way to challenge yourself — this guide will break down all of the different ways you can use bodyweight training to burn fat, build muscle, and upgrade your health. As long as your toddler (and dog) allows it, bodyweight workouts can happen in any room in the house, the garage, or even your local par This is important because the primary reason so many workouts fall short of the results you want is sustained consistency. Focusing on heavy weights is great — but not if you can’t lift them when needed The fact that you can do bodyweight workouts anywhere can help you build long-term consistency. Showing up week-after-week is where the real magic of training happens. When you remove steps (like driving to the gym and parking), building and sticking with any new routine becomes more straightforward. So, whether you focus on 1-2 bodyweight-only training days, or build your entire program around bodyweight movements, having an option that includes fewer barriers can play a key role in your success.

      description:"Neuroscientists have studied motivation and found that if your brain can understand your challenges, goals, and hurdles, then you’re more likely to have the type of mental energy needed to achieve your goals. It’d be great to have lots of motivation, but that’s not the default mode for many new tasks. When you try something new or want to achieve a goal, a part of your brain (your right prefrontal cortex) lights up that creates doubt and disbelief. Your brain is capable of helping you take on the world, but unfamiliarity can lessen your driveIf you want more motivation, you need to tap into the left prefrontal cortex, which increases mental energy and focus. This other side is fueled by hope, inspiration, and a belief you can succeed.What separates drive (left side) vs. dive (right side)Your brain needs to understand the actions it’ll take to achieve the goal, and it needs to feel realistic.If you can accept this concept, you will have the motivation needed to succeed with many diet and fitness plansWhy You Have Low MotivatioFor Diet and FitnesMany diet and fitness plans are a trap. One that is designed for you to start and stop with limited success. We help clients achieve every goal from fat loss to muscle gain, and we see a common pattern that we work to undo. The pattern usually falls into two categories: :Option 1: You want to start a plan and maybe buy a book or diet program. It’s possible you join a gym. But, you never really start or gain momentum. It’s frustrating from the start and you blame yourself.Option 2: You start a plan and feel excited. You get new workout clothes, buy healthy food, and dive in with extreme compliance. You likely see some initial success too. Eventually (usually around the 4-week mark), you’ve suddenly lost motivation, almost as if it was sucked from your body. Going to the gym is harder. Eating healthy is no longer empowering; instead, it now feels stressful.In both options, you end up in a similar position. The pressure starts getting to you. You sneak in desserts or snacks that are not part of the plan. Piece-by-piece, you start making decisions that you know are less than ideal, and — as a result — you give up on the vision of what you want to achieve.",

She had come to me after another friend of hers, Tracy, had lost weight working with me through my online training program, just 6 months after giving birthA deep breath followed, and Sarah asked why she should believe her body wasn’t programmed to look a certain wayI asked her to keep an open mind, stay patient, and to walk me through everything she had done. As she told me her tale of diet and exercise, I nodded and immediately knew what was wrongSarah was putting in time to her weight loss. But the type of effort she was giving—specifically her over-reliance on running—was a problem I had seen many times before, especially with womenI explained to Sarah the reasons why her type of running plan isn’t always the best way to lose fatNotice the wording there; I did not say running is bad or will make you fat. That’s just not true. It’s a great form of exercise and one with a lot of valueThis was about efficiency and understanding why your current cardio approach could be a reason why your jeans don’t fit better—even when you spend plenty of time in the gymSarah decided to give it a try and push ahead. One month later and 7 pounds lost, we have her back on track and believing that her body can changeIf you’re like Sarah and think your body is or are frustrated by your lack of progress, here are some simple adjustments you can make to make sure your running approach is not one giant weight loss mistake.Now that you know muscle is important to your overall weight loss goals, it only makes sense that you would want to do the type of exercises that help this happen the fastest and most efficient waIf you’re a lover of the slower, longer duration cardio, I have some bad news: “Endurance” running and walking (longer duration, lower intensity impairs strength and muscle growth, according to research in the Journal of Strength and Conditioning ResearchWhat’s more, even if you increase the intensity and run on an incline, cycling was still better for gaining muscle and burning fat, says researchers from Stephen F. Austin State UniversityAgain, the point here is not that “running doesn’t work” or that there aren’t any benefitsThis is about losing weight the most efficient way possible. And if you have limited time, you might be better served by cycling (preferably at a high intensity) as opposed to going for a longer walk or jogRunning Mistake #5: You RuToo Much (Yes, Too much!This might sound crazy, so just hang with me: The number on the scale might not be changing because you’re doing too much runningNow, I’ll be the first to admit that this isn’t problem for the majority of people struggling to drop a few pounds. But I’ve worked with many clients—and seen hundreds of other case studies—where fat loss has been stunted by doing too muchExercise is an undisputable component of a healthy life. However, exercise is still stress of your body. The demands of which impact your hormones, which also control your ability to lose fatSpecifically, the hormone cortisol is released when you exercise. All cortisol is not bad (despite what late night TV and supplement ads might have you believe), but chronic stress and chronic cortisol can lead to insulin resistance and force you to store belly fat against your best-laid plansAfter all, research published in the journal Hormone Research found that long distance running—like that done in endurance runners—causes a sustained increase in cortisol. And this increase in cortisol for long period of times can lead to more inflammation, slower recovery, breaking down your muscle tissue, building up fat, and even harm your immune functioningJust as bad, if you’re suffering from too much stress—whether it’s the result of exercises for too many hours or not recovering with the right nutrition—you can harm your thyroid and lower your metabolic rate, making weight loss more difficultIf you’re doing an hour of cardio per day, that’s more than enough for fat loss. (Remember, this isn’t for endurance training. If you start running 2 to 4 hours per day and aren’t losing weight (or maybe evening gaining), you might be best suited to reduce your running frequency, add some resistance training, and see what happens. Odds are, you’ll be pleasantly surprised.",

And, that’s before you have to deal with flip-flopping opinions that tell you to do something one day and avoid it the next.But, there’s a much shorter checklist that might be more helpful and cause a lot fewer headachesInstead of worrying about what you need to add to your life, it might be easier to think about addition by subtractionAvoiding the bad means you’re more likely to be doing something good — and isn’t that the pointMany years ago, Tim Ferriss created a “not-to-list” that applied to getting through life with less stress and frustration. It’s such a brilliant idea that I thought it should be applied to fitnessIn many ways, a not-to-do list is much more powerful than any version of “The 11 Best Foods You Should Eat,” the “20 Best Diets” or the “15 Most Effective Exercises.” What do all of these articles have in commonThey make it very clear that many things work with fitness and nutrition. So, picking the right plan is less about finding “the one approach that works” and more about finding “the right approach for you.” It’s a lot easier to accomplish if you avoid all of the garbage information that will lead you farther from your goalsAs with Tim’s original post, I highly recommend not trying to avoid all of these at once. Start with 1-3, master them (or, more accurately, just limit), and then add other items from the list as they apply to your health and lifestyle.",

      heading: "5 Ways To Fix Your Deadlift",
      images:"https://www.bornfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/4.png",
      description:"Why does the deadlift check so many boxes? For starters, it’s hard to use moment or cheat, and an overly eager spotter can’t give you support and “trick” yourself into thinking you’re improving. There’s no getting around it: The deadlift requires you to move a weight, and doing so has benefits for your entire body.   When you perform a deadlift correctly, it recruits just about every muscle fiber in the body, from your feet to your torso, and from your arms to your grip. Not to mention, the exercise isn’t hard to learn, says Mark Rippetoe, owner of the Wichita Falls Athletic Club in Texas and author of Starting Strength: Basic Barbell Training   But, if you want to see benefits —  much like any other exercise — you need to master the movement. The deadlift is not a dangerous exercise, but the key to its safety is making sure you set-up your body the correct way before you pull the weight. Rippetoe believes deadlift training is easier than teaching the squat or the bench press, and he can explain how to do it in just five steps. The “secret” if you will, is in the setup. About 80% of your strength and safety will come from hand, feet, legs, and chest positioning. Once you’re in a position of power, the rest of the actual movement itself is as basic as you’ll fin  But, before digging into the specifics, you should know that the deadlift requires some personal modifications. The reason: Unlike the squat or the bench press (where you can adjust the rack to your height), the starting point of a deadlift isn’t easy to customize. Most 45-pound plates are about 17.5 inches in diameter, which means the barbell connecting them will sit a little less than 9 inches off the ground. If you’re using dumbbells, it’s even farther to the floor to pick up the weight. (Using a trap bar is an alternative that helps alleviate this issue.   That’s great for some lifters—especially those with short arms and long torsos—but not others. Dan John, a strength coach and author of Can You Go?, will customize the lift for his clients by having them deadlift inside of a squat rack; this way, he can use the safety bars on the side to adjust the height of the starting point. “Some people will eventually deadlift off the floor, but for others the rack deadlift is all they ever need,” John says.",

      description:"Repetition is key when it comes to improving any skill. You don’t get better by setting goals—you get better by doing. “The goal is just an event — something that you can’t totally control or predict. But reps are what make the event happen,” says James Clear, author of Transform Your Habits. Changing your body requires the same mindset. No matter the skill—torching body fat, improving flexibility, or increasing muscle size— you’re going to have to put in the repetitions. Lucky for us, this process can be accomplished by adding 5-minute workout finishers—simple workout circuits—to the end of your program. These finishers will add crucial skill exposure to your routine during the week, and dramatically shorten the path to your goals.  Before we jump into the sample 5-minute finishers below, remember there are certain movement skills that are best developed at the beginning of the workout, not the end. Skills like top-end speed and cut-on-a-dime agility require high input from your nervous system, so work on those moves when you’re fresh, typically at the beginning of the workout (not what we’re doing here).",

We’re just saying the way they are implemented is flawed and, in many cases, not supported by researchIn fact, all the way back in 2012 in the International Journal of Sports Physical Therapy, more than 100 studies were reviewed and the takeaway wasStretching has not been shown to be effective at reducing the incidence of overall injuries.88 While there is some evidence of stretching reducing musculotendinous injuries,88 more evidence is needed to determine if stretching programs alone can reduce muscular injuries.If you want the benefits of warming up without dreading the typical process, we’ve tested dozens of different protocols on thousands of online fitness coaching clients and have found that there is a better way.

This is the kind of orange I prefer to work with when making a good Orange and almond cake. It’s a pleasant mix of sweet and sour that is carried beautifully by the moist almond crumb. Cut into neat thin slices, I say thin because the cake can be quite heavy, and serve with some whipping cream, whipped to soft peaks. Wash your kinnow oranges and add them to a pot filled with water and let the oranges merrily simmer away over a medium low heat for 2 hours uncovered, refilling the water in the pot if necessary. At the end of 2 hours the oranges should be very soft and you must carefully remove them.Let the oranges cool, then cut them and remove any seeds you may see. Place the remaining peels, fruit and any juices that may have been released while you tried to get the seeds out, into a mixer grinder and purée till smoothPreheat the oven to 180 degrees Celsius. Grease and flour a 9-inch cake tin and tap any excess flour out. Set this asideBeat all 5 eggs in a bowl and add the purée and mix well. Add the sugar, almond flour and baking powder and mix until no streaks of flour remain. You needn’t worry about overmixing herePour the batter into the prepared cake tin and transfer to the oven to bake for 45-50 minutes, or until a skewer inserted in the centre of the cake comes out cleanOnce the cake is done, let it cool in the tin itself before running a knife around the edges and inverting the cake tin to release the cake. Then flip it onto a serving platterCut into thin slices and serve with some whipped cream on the sideFor the whipped cream, only whip the cream when very cold and stop whipping at soft peaks stage.

While I would definitely agree that a finished Gobi Manchurian or Chilli Paneer is a thing of beauty and deliciousness, it’s not something I would make often simply because of the number of steps and the chances of messing up the kitchen and my hair. It originates from the Sichuan province of China and is characterised by the bold flavours and pungency from garlic, pepper, and specifically, Sichuan peppercorn. If you haven’t tried Sichuan peppers, it’s quite a treat and very different from regular black pepp They look similar and are red in colour, and have a numbing spiciness to them which hit your tongue quite differently. If you do intend to use it in this recipe, do so sparingly. I omit Sichuan peppers when making Szechuan eggplant at home because we prefer the Indian-Chinese variation of Sichuan cuisine The Indian-Chinese take on Szechuan cuisine has a liberal use of garlic as well, and pepper too.

I have used gelatine to set the mango layer but you can use agar gar or China grass, a vegetarian alternative used for the same purpose. This mango cheesecake is a great recipe to try during the summer mango season, fresh mangoes always work best but I have used canned mango pulp here for ease. I also suggest taking a look at my Eggless Oreo Cheesecake Recipe that uses no setting agents. Or maybe something like this Eggless Strawberry Mousse is more your type of desse Check out this very easy to make and delicious butter pudding recipe on the blog too.  I have taken pictures at every stage of this mango cheesecake recipe and I am going to force you to look at them (scroll down to the bottom for the short version without pics). This does not mean this is not an easy recipe. I mean, this is cheesecake you don’t need to bake. It really doesn’t get easier than that. Round up your ingredients and let’s get started.If you are a vegetarian or don’t want to use gelatine, you can use agar agar powder or China grass powder. It’s a plant-based thickener that works the same way as gelatine. You can find it in Asian stores and most supermarkets sell these in powder form or in strips. If you are using strips, dissolve 5 gm in 2-3 tbsp hot water until completely dissolved and use in the above recipe. The colour of the mango layer will depend on the mango puree you are using. Canned alphonso gives a deep colour like in the photos.  ",

Except for once or twice when I was a kid, Amma hasn’t made fruit cake at home from scratch because every year we are inundated with fruit cakes from friends celebrating Christmas.This year’s first cake is this Kerala plum cake from Omana Paul, a popular caterer and good friend of ours. Their plum cake is very popular and they make thousands at this time of the year. Amma had the recipe so I wanted to share it in time for Christmas. I have also shared an eggless fruit cake recipe if that’s what you are after. This tutti frutti cake is perfect for those who don’t really like plum cakes or raisins. I have a few of those in my family too but tutti frutti, they love!Let the fruit cake cool completely before cutting otherwise it will crumble.Typically, Kerala plum cake or our Christmas fruit cakes are not frosted so just dust the the cake with icing sugar or powdered sugar when the cake is completely cooled and store in airtight containers in room temperature for up to three days, or refrigerate for up to two weeks.For Christmas fruit cake / Kerala plum cake recipe in Malayalam, Hindi, Tamil, etc please use the Google translate button on the sidebar.",

It’s also a nice idea to serve this to guests if you are hosting a small party. Microwave individual portions of cookie, add some ice-cream on top, and serve as is. They’re sure to be impressed 🙂  ",

      description:"how I can make and eat dosa every day for a long time and still not be bored with it. It’s probably because we ate a lot of dosa growing up. Our family, or rather the Reddiar community in Kerala, always has homemade dosa batter in the fridge, ready to whip up fresh dosas on demand or for the unexpected guests whom we always insist stay for dinner.My mom has been using an industrial sized wet grinder for many years now and it is run about twice a week to keep the idli/dosa batter supply ongoing and fresh. We make idlis as soon as the batter ferments and then dilute the batter further to make dosas for the next 3-4 days. Dosa also needs batter that’s more fermented and sour than idlisCheck out this post for all tips and trips on how to make soft idlis with idli batter. use a table-top wet grinder for making dosa batter, pictured below. It’s the brand Ultra and has served me well now for 10+ years. It makes enough batter for a small family of four to last 4-5 meals and is perfect for us. Remember to use skinned, whole white urad dal and specific idli or dosa rice to make dosa batter at home.Dosa is arguably the most popular South Indian breakfast recipes, with its own variations and recipes used and passed down from generations. The way we make the batter is very simple and uses only two ingredients apart from salt – whole urad dal and par-boiled rice. There are certain versions of dosa batter that include aval or poha (flattened or beaten rice), fenugreek seeds, cooked rice, etc. We do none of that and just reply on urad dal : rice in 1 : 3 ratio",

I wanted to try a new cake recipe in the pressure cooker and finally found time to try it out. I adapted it to my taste and added some tutti frutti which was begging to be used.While I have baked this eggless sponge cake in a pressure cooker, you can use your oven to bake it too, just make sure to adjust the baking time accordingly. Also, while this is an eggless cake, you can substitute some ingredients out and add eggs to the cake if that’s what you prefer.While I don’t intend to use the pressure cooker for baking regularly, I did find one striking thing about this cake. The top and bottom of the cake was cooked perfectly and uniformly. Although I initially feared the top of the cake was burnt, it was actually cooked fine and was spongy and moist the entire day.",

A pulao should be simple, flavourful, have a good amount of vegetables (that’s why it’s called a vegetable pulao after all!), and also have a subtle hint of spices. And no matter what, I do not like to bite into whole pieces of cloves and cardamom when eating pulao or biryani. So I either pound them well before adding or remove them once the pulao is cooked. Painstaking, but worth it.When I made Palak Paneer the other day to share the recipe here, I made my go-to easy Veg Pulav to pair with it. I didn’t intend to share the recipe of the pulao here but a lot of you commented, emailed, and asked me on the FB page what that rice dish is and how to make it. This is the main rice dish I make when I spend some extra time making a side dish for pulao like Lauki Kofta Curry or Paneer Butter Masala or Soya Chunks Masala.I feel like two things are important for this pulao recipe. One, you need to get the right consistency for the rice. Here’s how I cook rice for pulao. Two, the spices need to be the right amount and this differs from taste bud to taste bud. If you prefer your pulao very light, add lesser amount of spices that I have mentioned below in the ingredients. I love adding green chillies to vegetable pulao since it gives a nice flavour but you can substitute with red chilli powder in a pinch, literally!

You can add just 1 tsp and let it double over a couple of hours, slowly. Also, if you are using yeast available in India, you need to proof it. To proof yeast, add it to 1/4 cup warm water and set aside for 10 minutes until bubbly. Then use it in the recipe as directed.

Or you can also make it with homemade paneer. Imagine a fun evening cooking this with your kids or even better, wow-ing your guests with an appetizer that hardly took more than 20 mins to make.

Paneer is a hard, neutral “cheese” that lends itself really well to being cooked into a gravy or curry and this particular recipe for paneer butter masala is arguably the most delicious. It is creamy, delicate, has a slight tang from the added tomatoes, and has a kick from the spices. You can adapt the flavour by adjusting the spices but in general, paneer butter masala is meant to be mild and creamy rather than a spicy curry. Paneer butter masala goes great with roti, vegetable pulao, chapati, puri, etc Check out other paneer recipes if you love cooking with paneer!I have one ingredient in this recipe, the canned tomato paste, which really adds to the flavour of the dish. Try not to omit or substitute it. You need very less but the rest of the can may be used for pasta sauce, tomato soup or refrigerated until you need more so you don’t waste it",

      description:"When you read “best of the west” on the food festival poster of Novotel Shamshabad,  you may be excused for thinking about food from the western hemisphere, you know the Americas, parts of Europe etc. Then you glance down to see Gujarat, Maharastra and Rajasthan (a bit of creative liberty there as Rajasthan is really more in northwestern India, it should have included Goa, you think) and you go bingo!It so happens that Tulshi Naik, the assistant F&B manager at Novotel Shamshabad is Gujarati and his wife Jahnvi is a great cook, so the idea was to tap into the talents of the in-house home chef. Since the executive chef Ramesh had also worked long years in Mumbai, Maharashtrian was added to the repertoire and probably as an afterthought, Rajasthani too. (just guessing!)Coming back to the event, the ambience created was perfect, right from the entrance. Rajasthani puppets, colorful festoons, waiters in leheriya pagdis and waistcoat jackets…the feel was pucca Mharo DesAt the bloggers table, we were first welcomed with some thandai and a platter of Gujarati farsaan, Fafda, Muthiya, Chakli and Chikki. In starters, there was Handvo, a steamed delicacy made of rice flour and four different kinds of dals, like tuvar, green moong, chana and urad dal, as well as grated bottle gourd. “It is usually served with tea as an evening snack with spicy pudina chutney. Traditionally, it was cooked over sand in an earthen pot on a slow fire, but now you get special handvo steamers, ” informs Jahnvi,",

      description:"August 15th 1947.  Though most of us were not around to experience the euphoria of being an independent nation finally, the historic date is imprinted in our minds and always will be. The same goes for Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru’s “tryst with destiny” speech at midnight on August 14th. Now, if one were to imagine a slice of euphoria dating from a few hours before that famous speech, declaring India’s independence, served up on our present dinner table, how incredible would that be? That is the brilliant concept curated by the Taj group of hotels, in a befitting tribute to the 70th year of India’s freedom. The three-course French haute cuisine dinner menu (rationing was rampant at the time) served at Taj Mahal Palace, Mumbai to cabaret entertainment and merriment on the night of August 14th, adapted and recreated to be a four-course menu Independence Day promotion in 2017 across Taj properties in the six metros: Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Pune, Hyderabad and Chennai I was, obviously, elated to be invited to a dinner preview table at Encounters, the coffee shop of Taj Krishna to experience the same We settled down to a four-course menu recreated by one of my most-fave chefs in Hyderabad, Nitin Mathur, known as much for his culinary chops as his creative plating. The menu read like this And guess what? Since my neighbor at the table was vegetarian and an ex colleague at that, I managed to try some soup from her bowl as well! Truth be told, I loved the almond soup better because it was creamier and more full bodied in a nourishing way. I also loved the croutons which had an almond inside each For starters, there was a single choice of Delicacies a l’Hindustan: Smoked paneer chunks in three different marinades, and this was truly spectacular. One was in a mint chutney version, tangily-addictive, but I also liked the lighter creamier ‘malai’ one as well as the red-chilli one, all of which were soft and succulent and redolent with their distinct flavours.",

      description:"Bidri, the erstwhile speciality Hyderabadi, and now Indian, restaurant of Marriott Hyderabad ranks pretty high on the pecking order, as far as my sensibilities for a fine dining experience goes. A stunning ambience, with its rich black and silver Bidri work-inlaid door and columns, crimson-hued chandeliers and sophisticated table ware, an excellently-crafted Riyasati Rasoi menu and impeccable service, with all this, Bidri never fails to deliver. Recently, the restaurant did a menu makeover in terms of adding a fresh line up of speciality and classic dishes, exclusive to the cuisine and culture of Hyderabad, United Punjab and Telangana. Eatopian Chronicles was invited to a preview dinner showcasing a soft launch of the same. While F&B manager Jomy Abraham had arrayed a huge table of food displays for photography purposes at Altitude (their eighth floor bar with a lovely view of Hussain Sagar) in-house celeb bartender Leo kept us ‘spirited’ while we got busy clicking.  Unfortunately, the man who was primarily responsible for the new menu, executive Chef Yogender Pal was away on a call of duty, but he had left his impeccable instructions for the team Later, at Bidri we were in for a huge line-up of diverse dishes, which defines Bidri.  In appetisers, there was the tangy and crisp Chemagadda 65, a Telangana special inspired by the more popular Chicken 65, Punjabi delight Dahi Bhalla, the Hyderabadi special Shikanja Murgh (boneless chicken breast in a green chilli-yoghurt marinade cooked in a traditional metal clamp), and two other Telangana hotties, Mirapakaya Kodi (boneless stir fried chicken with red chilli, ginger and curry leaves) and Bandameeda Chapa (catch of the day, in a fresh ground spice marinade which also included red chilli). We were served murrel steaks though for the plating purposes, it was a pomfret Memorables on this list were the Fish Fry, Dahi Bhalla and the Shikanja Murgh, as well as the dry chicken starter Mirapakaya Kodi.In main courses, were Raan e Bidri (leg of lamb braised in signature spices, cooked in a tandoor), Sepu Vadi (steamed urad lentil dumplings in a spinach fennel gravy), the Hyderabadi special Murgh Malai Korma, the Telangana Satti Mamsam Koora, Chikkudukai Aloo Gadda Talimpu (beans or ‘gavar’, potatoes cooked in mustard seeds, tempered with garlic, mustard seeds), the Punjabi Meat Beliram (lamb slow-cooked with fried onions, mustard oil and yoghurt) and Atta Chicken Coming to the superlatives: The Sepu Vadi (I had it earlier at the Himachali food pop up curated by chef Yogender Pal and had just loved the smooth creamy spinach curry and the bite of the “vadiyan”!).  I also loved the robust red-gravied Meat Beliram, apparently named after legendary Lahori chef Belliram and  the Telangana Satti Mamsam Koora, which also packed punch. Also good were the rather light and healthy Hyderabadi dish Murgh Malai Korma, with its creamy onion gravy and the Telangana beans stir fry, with its home style comfort food quotient",
